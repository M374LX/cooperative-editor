Cooperative Editor is a web-based tool used to test the effects of sound
workspace awareness with visually impaired users in a learning environment. It
is a part of the PhD of
[Rodrigo Prestes Machado](https://www.mendeley.com/profiles/rodrigo-prestes-machado/)
at [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul](http://ufrgs.br).

For more information, please go to Cooperative Editor's

The front-end previously used Polymer, but it is currently being ported to Vue.js.
